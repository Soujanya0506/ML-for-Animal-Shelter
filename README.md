# My Project Collections

These are the projects I have done throughout my time in Ritsumeikan APU. Most of the projects are personal except *ML for animal shelter* which was done as a part of assignment for Data Mining class.

- #### ML-for-Animal-Shelter
This project will be useful for no-kill shelters who can opt the given methods to optimize adoption of Pit Bulls and thus, can accommodate more needy animals for further adoption process. In order to conduct this project, Weka, a knowledge analysis software; developed at the University of Waikato (by Prof. Ian Witten); is used extensively, supported by Tableau, Microsoft Excel and Rapid Miner for Data Visualizations and Python programming for writing codes.
